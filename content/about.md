Founded in 1972, the Earl Park Fall Festival has brought the community together through music, camping, sports, games, food, and much more!

The Fall Festival is widely known for its FREE FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT including a Truck & Tractor Pull, Demolition Derby, Parade, Car Show, Softball Tournament, Horseshoe Tournament, Pedal Tractor Pull, Mud Volleyball, and more! The festival's large committee of volunteers is busy planning all of the special events that happen during the annual Labor Day weekend event. Anyone attending the festival can enjoy a craft and flea market, Bluegrass music, and concession food stands each day of the festival. There is a different dinner specialty everyday, including a fish fry, spaghetti dinner, chicken noodle dinner, and chicken dinner.
